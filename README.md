# SVAD

This repository contains modifications to SpeechBrain's CRDNN-based VAD model, making it conditional on ECAPA-TDNN embeddings to predict Speaker-specific VAD (SVAD). The code can be found in [VAD](https://github.com/radinshayanfar/speechbrain/tree/svad/recipes/LibriParty/VAD) directory.

This project was done as the final project of ELEC 872 @ Queen's University.
